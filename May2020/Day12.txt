Find a single element in a sorted array where every elemnt in the array is repeating twice except one.

1. DSA Used: XOR operation or it magic 
  2nd Method: For O(logn) time
  Compare odd or even index with mid and likewise call recursively (Binary seach variation)
2. Complexity: Hard
3. Time taken: more than an hour
4. Time Comlexity: O(logn)
5. Space Complexity: constant
