Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010.


#Learning
1. DSA Used: no specific. used bit wise operator
2. Complexity: easy because use (power(2, numOfBits) - 1) - num) trick learnt from GFG's DSA course
3. Time taken: 18 min
4. Time Comlexity: O(c)
5. Space Complexity: O(c)
