Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.

#Learning
first tried naive solution that is using map and 2 travesal. To optimize this learnt 2 other tehniques.
1. Using pair[256] that stores the freq and index and run throgh the array of pair and find the min index having 1 as freq.
2. Improvization of the above one: map and single traveral (same as above). 
Here map as int a[256] which stores the index of a character which repeats only once and run though the map, find the min index.

1. DSA Used: Map or pair
2. Complexity: Easy
3. Time taken: 25 minS (including learning other 2 techniques)
4. Time Comlexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: constant
