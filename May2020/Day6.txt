Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3

5. Space Complexity: O(1)

Learnt few techniques from GFG:
1. Moore's algo: find a candidate and run the loop and verify if its count is more than n/2
2. Hashing method
