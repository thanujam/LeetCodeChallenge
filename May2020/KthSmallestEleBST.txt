Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1


#Learning
1. Using recursion (inorder traversal)
2. Chnage the BST node's structure use of lcount (count of left subtree children)

1. DSA Used: recusion n In-Order traversal
2. Complexity: Meduim
3. Time taken: 40 minS (including learning other 1 techniques)
4. Time Comlexity: O(n)
5. Space Complexity: )(h)
