You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane

Check if the given point are lying in the straight line 


#Learning
Used collinearity fomula that is
if( numPoints < 2)
  return true;
else
 below condition should met
  (y3 - y2)(x2 -x1) = (x3 - x2)(y2 - y1)
  
  
1. DSA Used: Colinearity formula
2. Complexity: hard (since dint awre of formula)
3. Time taken: 55 minS 
4. Time Comlexity: O(1)
5. Space Complexity: constant
